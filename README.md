2. **Run the Docker Container**:
   ```bash
   docker run -d --name ice-cream-app-container -p 8000:8000 ice-cream-app
   ```

   - Replace `8000:8000` with the appropriate port mapping if your application uses a different port.

3. **Stop the Docker Container**:
   ```bash
   docker stop ice-cream-app-container
   ```

4. **Remove the Docker Container**:
   ```bash
   docker rm ice-cream-app-container
